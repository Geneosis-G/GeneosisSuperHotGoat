[quote=About this mod]As it's been a long time since the last mod I released, I decided to release this one now because it's certainly the smallest and the easiest I could do in my planned mods list :)
So not much to say about this mod as it's simply a reproduction of the main game mechanic of the game called "Super Hot". There was several ways to do that: either using ultra-slowmotion or complete time freeze. Sadly the complete time freeze (that you can use in Time Master Goat) was causing problems for controllers with this mod, so I used the ultra-slomotion instead ^^
